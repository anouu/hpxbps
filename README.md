## notes

I create a Vue app for this exercice, and Parcels JS as a bundle, it was fun.

I try to make simple otherwhise i'll take too much time, I think it's better to have some limitations.

I've had some some troubles with reactivity on first load still don't know why, I think i miss something.

I deploy the exercice on Heroku there: https://hpxbps.herokuapp.com/ but doesn't work because the API is not on https unfortunately
